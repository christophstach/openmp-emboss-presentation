  abstract="Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have attracted attention in the support of safe driving, intelligent navigation, and emergency and entertainment applications. VANET can be viewed as an intelligent component of the Transportation Systems as vehicles communicate with each other as well as with roadside base stations located at critical points of the road, such as intersections or construction sites. In this paper, we provide an overview of the context-aware processing and communication gateway associated with Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET). The concept of context-awareness, the recent advances and various challenges involved in context-aware processing are discussed. Some arising ideas such as based on context ontology, relevancy, hybrid dissemination, service oriented routing are also presented. This paper further briefly describes the communication gateway in VANET which includes its functional view together with the standards and their detailed preliminary specifications applicable to VANET.",

    abstract = {When it becomes possible to program decision-making based on moral principles into machines, will self-interest or the public good predominate? In a series of surveys, Bonnefon et al. found that even though participants approve of autonomous vehicles that might sacrifice passengers to save others, respondents would prefer not to ride in such vehicles (see the Perspective by Greene). Respondents would also not approve regulations mandating self-sacrifice, and such regulations would make them less willing to buy an autonomous vehicle.Science, this issue p. 1573; see also p. 1514Autonomous vehicles (AVs) should reduce traffic accidents, but they will sometimes have to choose between two evils, such as running over pedestrians or sacrificing themselves and their passenger to save the pedestrians. Defining the algorithms that will help AVs make these moral decisions is a formidable challenge. We found that participants in six Amazon Mechanical Turk studies approved of utilitarian AVs (that is, AVs that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good) and would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs that protect their passengers at all costs. The study participants disapprove of enforcing utilitarian regulations for AVs and would be less willing to buy such an AV. Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology.},
